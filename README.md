# Face-Generation
Generation of new faces using generative adversarial networks

In this project, I'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

## Dataset
CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter.Read [more](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) about dataset.

## Project
The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
